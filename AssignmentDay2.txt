 1- Lexical Structure
-> Lexical structure of Javascript is the set of elementary rules that specifies how we can write 
   programs in Javascript.It is the syntax of language ,it specifies how to declare variables 
   functions and statement.

   Literals and Identifiers
   Comments
   Case sensitive
   Optional Semicolon
   Reserved words

 2- Unicode
-> Computer stores letters and other characters by assigning a unique number for each.
   This standard of encoding (assigning) unique number is called Unicode Standard.
   Javascript is written in Unicode. Hence, we can use Emojis as variables and 
   we can write identifiers in any language.

 3- Keywords in Javascript
-> List of keywords
	1- await	
	2-break	
	3- case	
	4-catch	
	5-class
	6-const	
	7-continue	
	8-debugger	
	9-default	
	10-delete
	11-do	
	12-else	
	13-enum	
	14-export	
	15-extends
	16-false	
	17-finally
	18-for	
	19-function	
	20-if
	21-implements	
	22-import	
	23-in	
	24-instanceof	
	25-interface
	26-let	
	27-new	
	28-null	
	29-package	
	30-private
	31-protected	
	32-public	
	33-return	
	34-super	
	35-switch
	36-static	
	37-this	
	38-throw	
	39-try	
	40-true
	41-typeof	
	42-var	
	43-void	
	44-while	
	45-with
	46-yield

 4- Shorthand Operators are the shorter ways to write the expressions
    1- increment ++
       It is used to increase the value of operand by 1
       eg-
 		let a=5;
		a++;     // a=6;


    2- decrement --
       It is used to decrease the value of operand by 1
       eg-
 		let a=5;
		a--;     // a=4;

    3- +=
       eg-
		let a=5;
		let b=6;
		
		a+=b;   // a=a+b  a=5+6=11;

     Similarly we have -= , *= , /= , %= 

 5- "use strict" in javascript
     "use strict"  indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
     
     If we declare "use strict" at the start of js file , it will be applied to entire script,
     means if we use variable without declaring, it will throw an error.

   eg -
	without "use strict"
	abc=9;  //  we assigned a value to abc variable without declaring but will not throw an error

	with "use strict"
	
	abc=8;  //error 

	
    It helps to write clean and secure code.
